# Production readiness checklist

Tracks `docs/10-production-readiness.md` §10.6's pre-submission checklist
against what Phase 12 actually shipped in-code versus what's a manual step
in an external dashboard (Google Cloud Console, App Store Connect, Google
Play Console, a Sentry account) that no coding agent can complete from this
repo. See `DECISIONS.md`'s 2026-07-21 Phase 12 entries for the reasoning
behind each judgment call referenced below.

- [x] **No console logging of API keys or full network payloads in release
      builds** — `babel.config.js` strips all `console.*` calls from
      `production`/`preview` EAS build profiles (`eas.json` sets
      `NODE_ENV=production` on both) via `babel-plugin-transform-remove-console`.
      Audited `src/services/` and `src/db/repositories/` for logging —
      none found; the two existing `console.warn` calls
      (`src/lib/withTimeout.ts`, `src/lib/leaveBy.ts`) log diagnostic
      messages only, no keys or payloads.
- [ ] **Google Routes + AT keys restricted (§10.1)** — external, manual:
      requires signing into Google Cloud Console (restrict the Android key
      to the release SHA-1 + package name, iOS key to the bundle ID) and
      the AT dev portal. Can't be done from this repo/session — needs a
      real release keystore's SHA-1, which only exists once an EAS build
      has actually been produced.
- [ ] **Google Cloud budget alert configured (§2.1)** — external, manual:
      `Billing → Budgets & alerts` in the GCP Console, $5 NZD starting
      threshold per `docs/02-external-apis.md` §2.1. Requires the GCP
      project owner's console access.
- [x] **Location permission set to "when in use," with a real usage
      string** — confirmed `src/screens/onboarding/steps/Step1LocationPermission.tsx`
      only ever calls `requestForegroundPermissionsAsync()` (never a
      background/always variant); `app.json`'s `expo-location` plugin
      config sets a real `locationWhenInUsePermission` string ("...to set
      your current location as a journey starting point"), matching
      §10.4's exact suggested copy. `expo config` confirms only
      `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`/`ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` land in the resolved
      Android permission list — no background-location permission leaks
      in.
- [x] **Privacy policy URL live and linked in both store listings, crash
      reporting disclosed as opt-in (§10.5)** — `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` written
      this phase, covering exactly the four points §10.4 requires (what's
      collected, where stored, which third parties see it, crash-reporting
      opt-in status). "Live and linked" (i.e. actually hosted at a URL and
      pasted into App Store Connect / Play Console) is a manual step once
      a hosting choice is made (GitHub Pages is the spec's suggestion) —
      not something this repo can complete on its own.
- [x] **Crash reporting confirmed off by default on fresh install; toggling
      it on in Settings actually initializes the SDK (and off, actually
      doesn't)** — `src/lib/crashReporting.ts`'s `initCrashReportingIfEnabled()`
      gate, unit-tested in `crashReporting.test.ts`. See DECISIONS.md: the
      wired provider is a no-op (`NoopCrashReportingProvider`), not a live
      `@sentry/react-native` install — the on/off gating, location/label
      scrubbing, and "no telemetry connection while opted out" property are
      all real; swapping in a real DSN-backed provider later is a one-file
      change.
- [ ] **`PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` present (iOS)** — `app.json`'s
      `ios.privacyManifests` field is filled in (`NSPrivacyTracking: false`,
      precise-location collection declared, app-functionality purpose, not
      linked to identity, not used for tracking) and resolves correctly
      through `expo config`. Marked incomplete here because Apple's actual
      "required reason API" declarations (`NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypes`, e.g.
      for `UserDefaults`/file-timestamp APIs used by `expo-sqlite`/
      `expo-file-system` and their own dependencies) can only be verified
      against a real Xcode archive build, which this environment can't
      produce — third-party Expo modules typically ship their own
      manifests that get merged automatically at build time, but that
      merge should be checked against a real build before submission, not
      assumed correct from here.
- [x] **Export/Import data flow tested round-trip (delete app, reinstall,
      import)** — `src/lib/dataExport.ts` built (see DECISIONS.md for the
      photo-relinking approach that specifically handles the reinstall
      case, where `documentDirectory` paths from the old install are
      meaningless). Per `docs/11-testing-strategy.md` §11.2, the actual
      round-trip is an explicitly manual integration test, not a unit test
      — needs a real device/simulator build to actually run, which this
      session can't produce. Marked done for the code; the manual pass
      itself is still owed before submission.
- [ ] **Offline fallback (§5.1) verified for all three APIs** — pre-existing
      from Phase 11 (see that phase's DECISIONS.md entries); not re-verified
      this phase, no dev-menu (§12.2) exists yet to toggle each API off in
      isolation without a real outage.
- [ ] **Schema migrations (§3.1) tested against a fixture DB from the
      previous released version** — no prior *released* version exists yet
      (v1 hasn't shipped), so this specific check has nothing to run
      against until after the first real release.
- [x] **Unit test suite passing, `classifyWeather()`/`recommendGear()`
      coverage in particular** — 232 tests passing (`npx jest`), `tsc
      --noEmit` and `npx eslint .` both clean as of this phase.
- [x] **Light/dark/system theme toggle verified on both platforms (§9.1)**
      — built in Phase 11; `app.json`'s `userInterfaceStyle` changed from
      hardcoded `"light"` to `"automatic"` this phase so the native chrome
      (status bar defaults, etc.) actually follows the same preference the
      in-app theme system already does, closing a gap Phase 11 left in the
      native config layer specifically (the JS-level theme system itself
      was already complete).
- [ ] **Version/build numbers bumped from any prior submission** — set to
      `version: "1.0.0"`, `ios.buildNumber: "1"`, `android.versionCode: 1`
      for the first submission; `eas.json`'s `production` profile sets
      `autoIncrement: true` so subsequent builds bump automatically. Not
      checked off because "bumped from prior" has no prior submission to
      bump from yet.

## Additional items completed this phase (not on §10.6's list directly, but
required by §10.1–§10.4's body text)

- `eas.json` created with `development`/`preview`/`production` build
  profiles (§10.4).
- `app.json`: `ios.bundleIdentifier` / `android.package` set to
  `nz.co.commuteweatherplanner.app` (placeholder reverse-DNS — rename
  before real submission if a different org identifier is preferred, since
  bundle/package IDs can't change after a store listing is created).
  `android.allowBackup: true` set explicitly (§10.3, rather than relying on
  the platform default silently).
- App icon redesigned to match §10.4's concept: a flat, geometric amber
  umbrella silhouette (`accentWalk`'s hex, `#E8A860`) on the dark theme's
  `bg` token (`#161B26`), replacing the generic default Expo template
  icon. Generated `icon.png`, `android-icon-foreground.png`,
  `android-icon-background.png`, and `android-icon-monochrome.png`
  (Android 13+ themed-icon support) to match; `favicon.png` updated to the
  same mark. Verified legible at a simulated 40px.
- `STORE_LISTING.md` drafted (App Store + Play Store copy, leading with the
  "recommends your actual wardrobe" differentiator and stating the
  Auckland-only scope in the description itself, per §10.4).
